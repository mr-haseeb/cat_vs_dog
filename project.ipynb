    "## Problem 1: Molecular conformers\n",
    "\n",
    "a) A molecular conformer is a particular shape or atomic arrangement that a molecule can adopt. Often molecules will flip between these two arrangements of their atoms. The aim in this problem is to model the changes in the numbers of molecules in different shapes (conformers) over a period of time. We assume that there are two conformers of a particular molecule which we want to model, conformer $A$ and conformer $B$, and the total number of molecules is fixed, so that $n_A + n_B$ remains the same. We assume that every hour, 20% of the current population of conformer $A$ will turn into conformer $B$. However, there is a chance of also transitioning in the other direction, and so each hour, 10% of the molecules in conformer $B$ turn back into conformer $A$. We assume that initially, there are 150 '$A$ molecules' and 150 '$B$ molecules'. We also assume that the changes in populations take place in discrete time intervals on the hour, each hour.\n",

Show that by writing this as a vector, $$ \\begin{bmatrix} n_A \\\\ n_B \\end{bmatrix}$$ this can be recast as a single matrix equation with a linear system of equations. This will involve a $2 \\times 2$ matrix of fixed probabilities acting on this vector of current populations of $A$- and $B$-molecules, to give the populations in the next hour.** [3 marks]"

    "d) This long-time 'steady-state' behaviour can calculated directly, since we know that any vector where the application of a matrix results only in only a scaling of this vector (leaving the relative magnitudes of the elements of the vector unchanged) must be an eigenvector of the matrix. Specifically, if the populations are steady and not growing overall, the eigenvalue corresponding to this eigenvector must also be equal to 1.

    "## Problem 2: The logistic map\n",
    "\n",
    "In this problem we are considering the logistic map, a very simple sequence with very non-trivial behaviour. It simply updates a (scalar) variable, such that its next value depends solely on its current value. The sequence has the following form:\n",
    "\n",
    "$x_{n+1} = a \\times x_n \\times (1-x_n)$ ,\n",
    "\n",
    "where $x_n$ is the current variable in the range $[0,1]$, $x_{n+1}$ is the next value in the sequence, and $a$ is the growth rate which we will consider to be in the range $[0,4]$. This is often used to model systems which grow under a constraint of a finite number of resources, where e.g. $x_n$ represents the fraction of the total possible population size at a particular time. Here, the population will grow according to $x_n$, but be constrained by the $(1-x_n)$ term when $x_n$ gets too large. When $x_n=0$, the population is zero, and when $x_n=1$, the population is at its maximum possible size.  Indeed, since the resources are limited, the expansion is also proportional to $(1-x_n)$ and if the civilization reaches the maximum population of $x=1$ it will have exhausted all its resources and then collapses to $x=0$. Note that compared to the problem above, this sequence has non-linear (quadratic) terms in $x_n$, which has a profound affect, especially in the long-time limiting behaviour. As a background to this problem, I strongly recommend that you watch the following video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovJcsL7vyrk&list=WL&index=74&t=0s).\n",

    "One of the big challenges in mathematical physics is the solution to differential equations, such as Newtons equations.

We therefore aim to end up with two arrays for the $x$-coordinates and $y$-coordinates for each time step that we consider (as well as another set of arrays for the components of the velocity). Finally, to solve differential equations, we will need to specify an initial condition, i.e. the initial $x$ and $y$ position for the projectile, as well as the initial velocity in each direction. Considering the propagation in the $y$-direction (the $x$ direction is simple, as there is no acceleration and the velocity is therefore constant), we can write the expression for the propagation of the coupled $y$-position and $y$-velocity of the particle as\n",

It will also be worth initializing variables to store the initial speed, height and angle of the trajectory rather than hard coding them, so that these can be simply changed later on.**\n",
